# RamiAl-Saadi's Letters On Fire - a Fully OOP nodeJS game.

##  A fun (node js) guessing game: 

### Rami Al-Saadi's Letters On Fire an Object Oriented Programming Node Javascript game.

##### About

- It is a prototype of multiplayer Node.js  CLI guessing game that I started to develop
- The player must guess a book title one letter at a time and/or avoid the bomb exploding on his turn
- Difficulty of the game depends on the chosen length of the book title to be guessed
- The number of players and the length of the book title and the number of rounds can be chosen before the game starts
- I software engineered it using an OOP approach and designed and implemented it using Node.js and the Javascript programming language

##### Programming Language
- JavaScript

##### Runtime Environment
- Node.js

##### IDE
- Visual Studio Code
