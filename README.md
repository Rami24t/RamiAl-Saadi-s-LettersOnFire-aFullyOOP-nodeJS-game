##### About

- It is a prototype of multiplayer Node.js  CLI guessing game that I started to develop
- The player must guess a book title before the bomb explodes on his turn
- The number of players and the length of the book title and the number of rounds can be chosen before the game starts
- I software engineered it using an OOP approach and designed and implemented it using Node.js and the Javascript programming language
